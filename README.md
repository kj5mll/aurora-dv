# AURORA-DV

AURORA is a proposed open digital voice mode for amateur radio.

The goal of AURORA is simple:
to provide a clear, natural-sounding digital voice while remaining open,
non-proprietary, and friendly to modern amateur radio systems such as WPSD.

AURORA is not a finished product.
It is an idea and a direction for a digital voice mode that puts
audio quality, openness, and community first.

## Why AURORA Exists

Many current digital voice modes are:
- Proprietary or vendor-controlled
- Complex to understand or deploy
- Locked into specific ecosystems
- Difficult to improve or experiment with

AURORA aims to explore a different path.

---

## Core Principles

AURORA should always strive to be:

- Open-source
- Vendor-neutral
- Amateur-radio legal
- Focused on voice clarity
- Simple to deploy and experiment with
- Compatible with Linux-based repeater platforms

---

## Project Status

AURORA is currently in the **concept and discussion phase**.

No official implementation exists yet.
This repository exists to document the idea, gather interest,
and invite collaboration from the amateur radio community.

## Contributions

Ideas, discussion, and technical exploration are welcome.

This project values respectful collaboration and thoughtful development.
