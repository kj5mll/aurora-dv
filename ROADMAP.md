# AURORA Roadmap

This roadmap is aspirational, not a commitment.

Possible future directions include:
- Audio quality experimentation
- SDR-based prototypes
- Exploration of modern networking approaches
- Integration ideas for repeater platforms

Progress depends entirely on community interest and collaboration.
