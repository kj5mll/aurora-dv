# AURORA Vision

AURORA is intended to be an open digital voice mode for amateur radio.

AURORA is:
- Experimental
- Community-driven
- Focused on clarity and openness

AURORA is NOT:
- A commercial product
- A vendor-controlled system
- A closed or encrypted mode
- A replacement for existing modes

Any future development should respect these boundaries.
